### 1. Introduction

This documentation provides an overview of the AWS Lambda function 
developed to retrieve objects from an Amazon S3 bucket and return 
them as HTTP responses. The function is designed as a base line to 
be used in a production environment and follows best practices for 
reliability, performance, and security.

### 2. Function Overview

The AWS Lambda function, named `lambda_handler`, serves as an interface 
between client requests and an Amazon S3 bucket. It retrieves objects 
from the specified S3 bucket and returns them as HTTP responses. 
The function supports both text-based and binary (image) content.

### 3. Prerequisites

Before using this Lambda function, the following prerequisites should be in place:

- An AWS account with appropriate permissions to create and manage Lambda functions.
- Configuration of environment variables, including the S3 bucket name (e.g., `S3_BUCKET`).

### 4. Installation and Deployment

The deployment of this Lambda function typically involves the following steps:

1. Package the function code and dependencies into a deployment package.
2. Create a Lambda function in the AWS Management Console.
3. Configure environment variables, execution role, and other settings as needed.
4. Set up triggers or event sources if applicable.

### 5. Usage

This section provides detailed instructions on how to use the AWS Lambda function 
in various scenarios.

## 1. Retrieving Objects
To retrieve objects from the S3 bucket using the Lambda function, 
you can make HTTP requests to its endpoint.

## HTTP GET Request

Make an HTTP GET request to the Lambda function's endpoint, specifying the object's 
key in the S3 bucket as the path parameter.

# Example HTTP Request:  GET /myobject.jpg
The function will return an HTTP response with the requested object, including 
proper headers such as `Content-Type`.

### 6. Error-handling

## Error Handling
This section explains how the AWS Lambda function handles errors and provides 
guidance on handling and troubleshooting common issues.

## Error Responses
The Lambda function includes error handling to capture and return appropriate error 
responses. Common error scenarios include:

## S3 Object Retrieval Failure
If the Lambda function encounters an error while attempting to retrieve an object 
from the S3 bucket, it will return an error response with an appropriate status 
code and error message.

Example Error Response:
{
  "statusCode": 500,
  "body": {
    "error": "S3 object retrieval failed: Object not found."
  }
}


### 7. Security-considerations

## Security Considerations

This section highlights security considerations for using the AWS Lambda function 
and provides guidance on best practices.

## 1. IAM Roles and Permissions

Properly configuring IAM roles and permissions for the Lambda function is crucial 
for security. Ensure that the Lambda function has the necessary permissions to 
access AWS resources, such as the S3 bucket.


### 8. Monitoring-and-logging

This section explains how monitoring and logging are set up for the AWS Lambda 
function, allowing you to track its performance and troubleshoot issues.

## 1. CloudWatch Metrics

Key metrics related to the Lambda function's performance and resource utilization 
are captured in Amazon CloudWatch. These metrics include:

- Invocation count
- Duration
- Error count
- ...
